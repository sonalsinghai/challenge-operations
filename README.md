## Details

This repo contains 3 potential challenges for a DevOps/SRE/Platform Engineer role. These challenges are taken from our own history, and represent real-world problems we've seen and solved.

The candidate is expected to pick only ONE of these challenges to address and prepare a solution. The candidate does not need to submit this solution somewhere; instead we will review it during the live technical session. We will either make recommendations and suggestions to implement to form the live development task, or we will start from one of the not-attempted challenges; whichever option the interviewer feels best demonstartes the skills of the candidate.

It is strongly recommended that the candidate has a way to execute the solution they provide, maybe by preparing an environment ahead of the session.
